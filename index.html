  <p>I have looked at you in a million  ways and loved you in each. Thinking of you always, Mahal. You lift me up and hold me down, you make me smile when I'm feeling down. You bring me peace, you bring me gifts, you're the person I'm most happy to share my life with. The thought of you brings the biggest smile to my face. Sending love and smiles your way. Dear my sunshine, you light up my life. Anything is possible with the warmth of your love. Every day I love you more than the last. Thank you for bringing nothing but joy to my world. To the most beautiful girl in the world I am the luckiest to have you in my life. I love you, and may you never forget that. Thinking of you, loving you, and hoping you know if you need anything, I'm always here for you. There are all types of love in this world, but never the same love twice. The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along. If I know what love is, it is because of you. I may never find words beautiful enough to describe all that you mean to me, but I will spend the rest of my life searching for them. You are a ray of living breathing sunshine who holds the power to burn out everything around her with her beauty. Also, you have the sweetest smile, which melts my heart, mahal. Thank you for being a competition to Aphrodite, the beautiful goddess envies you. I bet. I may not be perfect but girl, I hope you know that I can ride and die for you. You are my everything, mahal. You have blessed my life in every way, and I am forever grateful to Almighty for sending you in my life. You came into my life out of nowhere and made it a better place without any doubts. Thanks for existing, mahal. Someone should have stopped me from falling in love with you. Now I am so lost in loving you that I can barely separate my soul from yours. Every moment I find myself thinking about you. You have become the reason for my smile, the meaning of my life, and the inspiration for tomorrow. You are the sunshine that fades all the darkness in my life. You are my road to redemption. I have never loved someone so deeply than you. I love you more than I can say. I am lucky to be part of your life. I will love you till my last breath! Your sweet smile is my inspiration for starting every day with new hopes and dreams. Your sweet voice is the reason why my life is so peaceful. Thanks for coming into my life and making it more wonderful than ever. I owe you everything! Loving you is like an addiction to me. Every moment I spend loving you is like the moments I spend in heaven. The day I will stop loving you is the day I die. I love you more than myself. keep up that sweet smile on your face always! Every morning when I wake up the first thing that hits my mind, is you. I close my eyes and picture your beautiful face in my head so I can start the day full of positivity. I feel lucky to have you in my life. You are a blessing that I will be thankful to God for the rest of my life. My life was incomplete before you came into it. Since I met you, my life has changed completely. You are like a flower that has many fragrances in it. Thanks for decorating my life with the colors of your love. I love you! I never thought of falling in love with someone I barely knew. Then suddenly I met you one day and something in my ear whispered that this is the girl that I have ever wanted in my life. Since then, all I know is that I love you and want to be with you forever. I fell in love with you and fell so deep down that nothing in this world can pull me up from here. I thought heaven was up in the sky but now I know heaven is falling deep down into love. All of my sad moments just disappear and I even start laughing at the stupidest joke. Do you know any magic? Or is it just me so lost in loving you? True love comes at the most unexpected moment and it costs nothing at all. But what is even more interesting is that for some people, it comes with a package full of cuteness. I belong to those lucky ones. I love you! It’s a pleasure for the eyes to see you smiling. I have never known anyone with such a cute smile on her face. If you knew how much my heart craves for you, you would never keep yourself away from me. I love you truly, madly, and deeply! To me, you are sublime. You are one hundred orchestras playing the most beautiful symphonies at once. You are the most impressive sunset glowing behind the tallest cliff. Your presence overwhelms and soothes me in a way that I’ve never experienced. My mind has been restless since the day we met, and I cannot think of anyone or anything but you. The most beautiful, intelligent, amazing woman in the world deserves the coolest, slickest, funniest guy. So it makes total sense that you’re with me! Who am I kidding, you’re miles out of my league. Thank you for loving me, no matter how goofy I can be. When I first met you, I was starstruck. I thought you must be famous or something. When we started dating, I couldn’t believe my luck. Every day, I am thankful for you. I love you forever. I have read endless love stories, listened to a thousand love songs, and watched a few hundred romantic films. Yet, not a single one compares to our love story. Nothing will ever be as beautiful as our romance. Did you know that there are now eight wonders of the world? Seven are scattered all across the globe, but only one of them is reading this message. You are the most beautiful site on Earth. I love you with all of my heart, and you bring wonder to my life every day.</p>
